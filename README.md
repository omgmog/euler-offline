## Euler Offline

A quick node script that offlines the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) questions, so you can work on them anywhere.

This uses [Jam API](http://www.jamapi.xyz/) to scrape the titles and question data from Project Euler.

## Usage

```shell
$ npm install require fs
$ node index.js
```

This will create the `questions/problem-xxx.js` files, which you can then work through in your editor of choice.

## What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
